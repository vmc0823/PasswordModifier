Many user-created passwords are simple and easy to guess. Write a program that takes a simple password and makes it stronger by replacing characters using the key below, and by appending "!" to the end of the input string.

i becomes 1
a becomes @
m becomes M
B becomes 8
s becomes $
Ex: If the input is:

mypassword
the output is:

Myp@$$word!
